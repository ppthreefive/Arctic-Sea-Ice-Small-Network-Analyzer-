# Arctic Sea Ice

This program is designed to represent climatological data of the beaufort sea region as a graph, and then we compute characteristics of it to determine if it is a small-world graph. This program specifically uses the data set gathered from the SMMR-SSM/I passive microwave data set and finds anomalies, so that it is more amenable to statistical analysis.
